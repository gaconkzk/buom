This project was bootstrapped with
[Bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender) init script.

- Walking through persistence models of bottender
- Create cool handlers (might considers the bootender-compose project for utils)
- wit.ai/diaflow.js ... should be integrated as middleware
- multimedia messages should be as abstract as possible
- ...


Something for me:
- I'll tried to make it as clean and readable as possible
- I'll tried to make it as easy for extends as possible
- I'll tried to make it as generic for multiple usages scenarios as possible
